# Netflix Dashboard
This repository consists of a dashboard created using Tableau, along with my analysis for the graphs. 

This dashboard represents facts about the unique movies and shows that were aired on Netflix until 2021. We can see that understandably the United States is the largest producer on this OTT platform followed by India. Movies occupy about 70% of the total content produced, with over 6000 released so far. Interestingly, the genre “Documentaries” is on the top, making me question my own preferences. This dashboard also allows users to search title specific details such as the duration, release year and description. Lastly, looking into the Ratings bar graph, we can see how adult content surpasses other categories marginally. Clearly, “Netflix & Chill” is not for kids.
